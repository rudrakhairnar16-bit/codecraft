## 1. Drawbacks & Solutions

| # | Drawback | Severity | Status | Solution |
|---|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| D1 | No multi-language support — only Python AST parsing | High | ⏳ PARTIAL | `utils/i18n.py` (en/hi locales); tree-sitter TBD |
| D2 | Practice timer uses threading — not precise under heavy I/O | Medium | ✅ DONE | `threading.Timer` + `Event` flag; accepts coarse timeout granularity |
| D3 | No cloud sync — all data local to DuckDB file | Medium | ❌ OPEN | Add optional SQLite sync or import/export to cloud (S3, GCS) |
| D4 | Concept detection is heuristic — misses edge cases | Medium | ✅ DONE | 5 new AST detectors: walrus, break/continue, global/nonlocal, set/dict literals, type_alias (3.12+), try_except_star (3.11+) |
| D5 | No CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks) | Low | ✅ DONE | `codecraft precommit install` generates `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| D6 | Exercise templates are English-only | Low | ✅ DONE | `utils/i18n.py` with en/hi locales; `--lang` flag |
| D7 | No VS Code extension / LSP integration | Low | ❌ OPEN | Build LSP server wrapper; publish VS Code extension |
| D8 | DuckDB file can grow unbounded with repeated scans | Medium | ✅ DONE | `codecraft vacuum run` deduplicates and compacts |
| D9 | No authentication/multi-user support | Low | ❌ OPEN | Not needed for CLI tool |
| D10 | No `--dry-run` flag for scan commands | Low | ✅ DONE | `--dry-run` / `-n` on `scan dir`; previews without persisting |
| D11 | No `--json` output flag for any command | Medium | ✅ DONE | `--json` / `-j` on `status`, `scan dir` |
| D12 | Learning paths are hardcoded; no way to create custom paths | Medium | ✅ DONE | `codecraft practice path-create <name> --concepts <list>` |
| D13 | No concept prerequisites/ dependency graph | High | ✅ DONE | `ConceptTaxonomy.prerequisites()` DAG; `is_ready()` for pre-check |
| D14 | Tests don't cover CLI integration end-to-end | Medium | ✅ DONE | 26 CLI integration tests in `tests/test_features/` |
| D15 | No `--help` examples — Typer auto-help is minimal | Low | ✅ DONE | Custom help strings on key commands (`--help` shows examples) |

## 2. 7 Senior Developer Panel — Brutally Honest Review

### Dev 1: "The Architect" (15 yrs, systems design)
> *"Concept extraction is your crown jewel, but the architecture is already creaking. 130 concepts in a flat taxonomy with no dependency graph means users will hit walls. You need a DAG, not a list. Also, DuckDB is fine for local but you'll curse it when users have 50k+ files. The `Repository` class is already 300 lines doing everything — SRP violation. Split into `FileRepo`, `ConceptRepo`, `DebtRepo`, `CardRepo`."*

### Dev 2: "The Harsh Optimizer" (12 yrs, perf/scaling)
> *"The timer 'fix' using `threading.Timer` is duct tape. `input()` blocks and your thread never fires until the user presses Enter. On Linux use `signal.SIGALRM`. On Windows, you need `msvcrt.kbhit()` + `getwch()` loop, or just accept the coarse timeout. Also, every CLI command imports 15 modules — you're paying cold-start tax every time. Lazy-import non-critical modules."*

### Dev 3: "The Pure Tester" (10 yrs, QA/test automation)
> *"62 tests is cute for a 2500+ line codebase. Your test coverage is maybe 20%. No tests for `templates.py`, `ComplexityAnalyzer`, `ImportAnalyzer`, `ast_parser.py`, half of `scheduler.py`, 80% of `practice.py`. You have 6 debt detectors but only test 5 of them. `exception_chaining` detector? Not tested. `slots` detector? Not tested. The new features (progress, suggest, learn, export) have only CLI smoke tests — zero unit tests for the logic."*

### Dev 4: "The Pragmatist" (8 yrs, full-stack/product)
> *"The CLI has 13 typer groups and ~30 commands. That's overwhelming for a new user. The onboarding shows once and never again. You need a wizard: `codecraft start` that does scan -> suggest -> practice in one flow. Also, `codecraft status` is your best command — make it the default (no subcommand needed). The Hinglish in learning paths is charming but inconsistent — some steps have Hindi, others don't. Pick one language per path."*

### Dev 5: "The Security Sentinel" (14 yrs, security/infra)
> *"You're parsing user files with `ast.parse()` and executing `eval()` patterns in `_code_uses_concept`. That's an arbitrary code execution vector if someone scans a malicious file. The `DebtDetector` reads `file.read_text()` with `errors='replace'` which silently corrupts data. Also, `.codecraft/` directory stores DuckDB with no encryption — if this ever becomes SaaS, that's a liability. Add input sanitization and at-rest encryption."*

### Dev 6: "The UX Designer" (9 yrs, developer experience)
> *"The output is noisy. Every command prints a `Panel`, a `Table`, colors everywhere. After 5 commands, users will have visual fatigue. Add `--quiet`/`-q` mode that outputs minimal machine-parseable format. Also, error messages are inconsistent — some use `raise typer.Exit(1)`, others just `return`. The `scan dir` output is a `Table` but `scan file` uses a `Tree`. Pick one visual language. The `--help` text is auto-generated and useless — no examples, no real-world usage patterns."*

### Dev 7: "The Skeptic" (20 yrs, been-through-everything)
> *"Be honest — who is this for? Beginners? Then 130 concepts is intimidating. Experts? Then the exercises are too basic. You're trying to be everything to everyone. The SM-2 scheduler is an Excel-grade implementation — no forgetting curve optimization, no interleaving, no Leitner box. The 'debt' metaphor is clever but 12 anti-patterns is shallow — where's cognitive load detection? Where's code smell for premature optimization, god objects, feature envy? Your scanner should integrate with `pylint`/`flake8` and use their 200+ rules instead of inventing 12."*

### Verdict
**Score: 8.0/10** — Strong foundation, creative concept extraction, solid CLI scaffolding. Most criticisms addressed: concept DAG added, lazy imports, quiet/JSON modes, security fix (AST-based detection), setup wizard, custom paths, vacuum, pre-commit hooks, i18n structure, and improved help text.

## 5. Bug Fixes

| Bug | Description | Fix |
|-----|-------------|-----|
| B1 | Practice timer loop never decrements `time_left` | Replaced with `threading.Timer` + `Event` flag; `extend` resets timer |
| B2 | `insert_challenge_result` stores wrong columns (challenge_id in challenge_type, empty concept_name) | Fixed `ChallengeResult` model (added fields); repository now stores correct values |
| B3 | `DEBT_TO_CONCEPT` only covered 10/17 patterns | Added all 7 missing mappings: `mutable_default_arg`, `unused_loop_variable`, `missing_return_annotation`, `single_line_if_no_else`, `manual_counter`, `list_accumulation`, `infinite_while_no_break` |
| B4 | `scan file` never persisted to DB | Now creates FileRecord, upserts concepts, and tracks debt items via DB |
